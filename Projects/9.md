    We use fopen to open the file. If the file is null, we report an error. If isn't, we use the fgets method to read the file line by line after that filereader closes.
     /proc/interrupts: This file records the number of interrupts per IRQ on the x86 architecture. The first column refers to the IRQ number. Each CPU in the system has its own column and its own number of interrupts per IRQ. The next column reports the type of interrupt, and the last column contains the name of the device that is located at that IRQ. 
    ```.c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    
    int main()
    {
    
        FILE *file = fopen("/proc/interrupts", "r");
        if (file == NULL)
        {
            printf("error");
            exit(-1);
        }
        char buff[100];
        while (fgets(buff, 100, file))
        {
            printf("%s", buff);
        }
    
        fclose(file);
        return 0;
    }

## Section 9.4
- [x] Adding a new interrupt  
    - [x] `FILL HERE with your descriptions (write in English or Persian)`
    To produce an interrupt, a kernel module with the request irq() function must be written.
This function returns an integer, and if it is zero, the creation of the interrupts was successful.
Anything less is an abject failure.
The free irq() function should then be used to resolve the interrupt and remove it from the list of /proc/interrupts.
request_irq ()/* Install the interrupt handler for the given interrupt source */;
free_irq ()/* Free the memory allocated to the given interrupt */;
enable_irq ()/* Call the interrupt control function to make the given interrupt chain valid */;
disable_irq ()/* invalidate the defined interrupt chain */

    int request_irq(unsigned int irq,
                    void (*handler)(int, void *, struct pt_regs *), unsigned long irqflags, const char *devname, void *dev_id);
    void free_irq(unsigned int irq, void *dev_id);
