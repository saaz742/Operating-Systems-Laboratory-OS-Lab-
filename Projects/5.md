- [x] Investigate how to have a bi-direction pipe
    - [x] `FILL HERE with your descriptions`
    cmd1 <&1 | cmd2 >&0
    One pipe can be used to read the child and write the father, and the other pipe can be used to read the father and write the child when two pipes are utilized between the father and child.
    Instead of pipe, you may alternatively use named pipe or FIFO. These pipes' lifespans are independent of the processes' lifespans; they function similarly to files and can be created with the mkfifo command. As a result, the processes are able to read from and write to the same file and communicate with one another. Additionally, two processes from two different operating systems can be joined across the network by employing these types of pipes. 
    

### Section 5.3.2

- [x] Describe the usecase of different signals:
    1. [x] `[FILL HERE with the description for SIGINT.]`
    ```.c
    int SIGINT;
    //The SIGINT (“program interrupt”) signal is sent when the user types the INTR character (normally Ctrl-c) and thrown to the processor during the interrupt.
    ```
    1. [x] `[FILL HERE with the description for SIGHUP.]`
    ```.c
    int SIGHUP;
    // The SIGHUP (“hang-up”) signal is used to report that the user’s terminal is disconnected, perhaps because a network or telephone connection was broken.
    //This signal is also used to report the termination of the controlling process on a terminal to jobs associated with that session; this termination effectively disconnects all processes in the session from the controlling terminal.
    ```
    1. [x] `[FILL HERE with the description for SIGSTP.]`
    ```.c
    int SIGSTOP;
    //The SIGHUB tells a process to “hold on'. it generated when a running process is terminated and causes the process to suspend execution. (Shortcut: Ctrl-Z)
    ```
    1. [x] `[FILL HERE with the description for SIGCONT.]`
    ```.c
    int SIGCONT;
    //The SIGCONT tells a process to “pick up where you left off”. This can work really well for rsync jobs since you can pause the job, clear up some space on the destination device, and then resume the job.
    ```
    1. [x] `[FILL HERE with the description for SIGKILL.]`
    ```.c
    int SIGKILL;
    //The SIGKILL signal is used to cause immediate program termination. It cannot be handled or ignored, and is therefore always fatal. It is also not possible to block this signal.
    //This signal is usually generated only by explicit request. Since it cannot be handled, you should generate it only as a last resort, after first trying a less drastic method such as SIGINT. If a process does not respond to any other termination signals, sending it a SIGKILL signal will almost always cause it to go away.
    ```

- [x] Describe SIGALRM
    1. [x] `[FILL HERE with your description.]`
    ```.c
    unsigned int alarm(unsigned int seconds);
    //The alarm() function is used to generate a SIGALRM signal after a specified amount of time elapsed.
    //he function takes one argument, seconds. After seconds seconds have elapsed since requesting the alarm() function, the SIGALRM signal is generated.
    //The alarm() function will return a non zero value, if another alarm has been previously set and the value is the number of seconds remaining for the previous scheduled alarm due to delivered. Otherwise alarm() will return zero.
    int SIGALRM;
    //SIGALRM is an asynchronous signal. The SIGALRM signal is raised when a time interval specified in a call to the alarm or alarmd function expires.
    //Because SIGALRM is an asynchronous signal, the SAS/C library discovers the signal only when you call a function, when a function returns, or when you issue a call to sigchk . For this reason and because of inaccuracies and overhead in operating system timing functions, you can consider the time interval requested by alarm a lower bound; the handler may not be invoked immediately after the interval expires.  
    ```

- [x] Investigate the given code
    1. [x] `[FILL HERE with your description.]`
    The alarm(5) command was issued before the while(1), which would have caused the program to enter an infinite loop, therefore it is paused and terminated after 5 seconds.
As a result, the first printf that came before the while is run, but the second printf that comes after the while is skipped, and the process is immediately terminated by the SIGALRM signal. 
    1. [x] `[FILL HERE with screenshot of program execution]`

- [x] Modify the given program by handling SIGALRM
    1. [x] `[FILL HERE with your source code.]`
    ```.c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <signal.h>
    
    void ret()
    {
            return;
    }
    
    int main()
    {
            signal(SIGALRM, ret);
            alarm(5);
            printf("Looping forever . . . \n");
            pause();
            printf("This line should never be executed\n");
            return 0;
    }
    ```

- [x] Write a program that handles Ctrl + C
    1. [x] `[FILL HERE with your source code.]`
    ```.c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <signal.h>
    
    void ret()
    {
        return;
    }
    
    int main()
    {
        signal(SIGINT, ret);
        alarm(5);
        pause();
        printf("interupt again\n");
        pause();
        printf("intrupted\n");
        return 0;
    }
    ```
