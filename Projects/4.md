- [x] Infromation about processes with PID = 1
    1. [x] `[FILL HERE with description.]`
    ```
    Systemed/init process:
    The initial process created in Linux is the systemd or init process. The system and its services are typically managed through this process. This procedure's primary goal is to configure Linux kernel services across various distributions. When the system boots, this function begins the services needed to configure and manage the user space. The components of this process are built from various text files when the operating system is booted (/etc/systemd/system), and it then begins to load services and other processes. 
    ```

### Section 4.4.2


- [x] Program using getppid
    1. [x] `[FILL HERE with your program code.]`  
     ```.c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    int main()
    {
        printf("pid: %d\n", getpid());
        return 0;
    }
   ```

    1. [x] `[FILL HERE with descriptions about the parent process]`
    ```
      ps is for process status.
      The terminal is the process that carries out the user's orders. The parent process will be bash because the command to compile and run the code is executed in bash. So bash is the parent process.
  ```

- [x] Describe the C program (fork program)
    1. [x] `[FILL HERE with descriptions]`
    ```
    A child process of the program's main process is generated in this code. When the child process is finished, the parent process waits. The kid process gives back the number 23. The parent process then receives this value and outputs it. The value of ret for the parent process following the fork function is equal to the pid of the child and is equal to 0 for the child process. As a result, the parent process runs the code inside else, while the first process runs the code inside it.
   ```

    ```
    There are two processes after the first fork; so the string is written twice. Following the second fork, each of the two processes now generates a new process. The string following the second fork is therefore written four times and there are four process. Then if there are more fork, each of the four processes will run the fork one more time, and eight times will be printed in the entire string following the third fork, resulting in the creation of eight processes overall.
    ```

    #include <sys/wait.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    int main()
    {

        }

            printf("done.\n");
        }
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    1. [x] `[FILL HERE about description for the parameter of wait system call]`
    ```
    A pointer to an int variable that stores a value once the child process's execution is complete is provided as the first parameter of the wait function. This value can be used to determine how the child process was terminated by utilizing macros like WIFEXITED or WIFSIGNALED. To learn more about the return value of the kid or the quantity of stop signals issued to it, use other macros like WEXITSTATUS or WSTOPSIG.

### Section 4.4.4

- [x] Describe following commands/APIs:
    1. `[FILL HERE with description about execv]`
    ```.c
    int execv(const char *path, char *const argv[]);
    
    //The execv(), execvp(), and execvpe() functions provide an array of pointers to null-terminated strings that represent the argument list available to the new program.
    //The first argument, by convention, should point to the filename associated with the file being executed. The array of pointers must be terminated by a NULL pointer. 
    ```
    1. `[FILL HERE with description about execl]`
     ```.c
    int execl(const char *path, const char *arg, ...);
    
    //This command is like execv. The only distinction is that it accepts each parameter as an individual string rather than a list of arguments. 
    ```
    1. `[FILL HERE with description about execvp]`
    ```.c
    int execvp(const char *file, char *const argv[]);
    
    //The only difference with execv is that when receiving the address of the program, if filename does not start with "/" it finds its address by looking in the standard PATH environment variable and then executes it. 
    ```
    1. `[FILL HERE with description about execlp]`
    ```.c
    int execlp(const char *file, const char *arg, ...);
    
    //This command is like execvp. The only distinction is that it accepts each parameter as an individual string rather than a list of arguments.
